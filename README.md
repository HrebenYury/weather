This weather application is my first project on React. 

If you want to start this project you need to create a `.env` file with API keys.


```javascript
    REACT_APP_GEOCODES_API_KEY = "api key for geodata"
    REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY = "api for weather data"
```

[openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) - Weather API
[positionstack.com](https://positionstack.com/) - Geocoding REST API


It is simple weather viewer with seven days forecast. The application is also adaptive.
