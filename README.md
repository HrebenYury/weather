This weather application is my first project on React. If you want to start this project you need to create a ".env" file with API keys.

REACT_APP_GEOCODES_API_KEY = "api key for geodata"
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY = "api for weather data"

https://openweathermap.org/ - Weather API
https://positionstack.com/ - Geocoding REST API

It is simple weather viewer with seven days forecast. The application is also adaptive.
